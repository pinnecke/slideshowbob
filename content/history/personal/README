THIS DIRECTORY MUST NOT BE REMOVED

This directory contains the history of personal slides formatted as markdown file for individual presenters. 

Everytime a presentation was commited (via 'python commit.py'), the latest slide content for a presenter
is added on top of the history of that presenter. Additionally, the commit name (typically the presentation
day) is added as the headline within the markdown file. 

If the history of a presenter should be removed, remove the presenters markdown file.
